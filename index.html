    <h1>Examining the Drug Overdose Death Epidemic </h1>
    <p>Drug overdose deaths have emerged as a major public health crisis in the United States. This narrative explores key trends and insights into overdose mortality rates from 1999 to 2022, evaluates the effects of policy interventions over time, and investigates potential correlations between overdose deaths and unemployment rates.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2> From Coast to Heartland: How Overdose Deaths Vary Across the U.S.</h2>
  <p>The tile map highlights sharp contrasts in overdose death rates across states. West Virginia (29.0 deaths per 100,000) and Maryland (17.5) reported some of the highest averages from 1999 to 2022, while Hawaii (4.4) and Nebraska (2.7) maintained much lower rates.</p>
  <p>Missouri, historically limited in Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PMP) regulations, consistently faced higher overdose death rates than many peers. Selecting a state reveals how local trends have evolved alongside national patterns. For example, Washington, once below the national average, experienced a sharp rise over the past two decades.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Who Is Most Affected? Exploring Demographic Trends in Overdose Deaths</h2>
    <p>Across years, the overall trend in drug overdose death rates shows a steady increase nationally. This pattern is consistently reflected when broken down by demographic groups and sex.</p>
    <p>Although absolute overdose death rates differ across racial groups and between males and females, the general upward trend remains evident across all categories.</p>
    <p>In particular, males consistently experience higher overdose death rates compared to females, and certain racial groups such as American Indian & Alaska Native populations and White populations report higher rates than others. These trends suggest that while the magnitude of risk varies by demographic factors, the broader escalation of overdose mortality is a shared national experience.</p>

    <h2>Overdose Death Rates and Unemployment</h2>
    <p>States that adopted opioid prescribing limits and monitoring programs earlier often saw reductions in opioid prescribing and overdose death rates. However, effects vary widely by region and population.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Addressing the opioid crisis requires a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support strategies. Continued monitoring and data-driven policy interventions are critical to mitigating the public health impacts of this epidemic.</p>
